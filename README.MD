# BatchDropper
A simple program that makes a batch dropper. The dropper contains every hex value of a file, so usually, the dropper's size is big.
Note: I used powershell command instead of batch because 90% of cases file size increase more thanÂ 8192. (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/troubleshoot/windows-client/shell-experience/command-line-string-limitation).
